# Php Command Generator

> A lightweight command generator built on Symfony

## What is the purpose of this package?
### Php command generation without a massive framework but with the same ease of use. 

>so that you can focus on implementing the command logic, 
instead of focusing on the boring boilerplate.

## Usage

```php
php commando make:command <ExampleCommand>
```

***You will find your newly created command in the Commands directory.***

> The command will be automatically generated and registered in the super lightweight service container. 

All you need to do now is write your command logic. 

Happy coding :-)
